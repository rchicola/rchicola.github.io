How sensitive are e-commerce purchases to state sales taxes? Understanding
the interplay of online consumer behavior, state sales tax policy
changes, and competitive dynamics of online retail consumption relies on
by empirical elasticity estimates. This paper exploits timing variation in
the imposition of state sales tax onto online purchases to estimate demand
elasticities for online and traditional brick and mortar retail shopping.
Elasticities of demand for goods sold online with respect to prices for
online goods of 1.255 and 1.227 were found for uncompensated and compensated
demands, respectively, when evaluated at their sample mean for
the unconstrained preferred demand estimation specification. The large
elasticities imply that collecting sales taxes from online retailers shifts
consumption partially back to brick and mortar retailers. For example, if
California did not impose sales on online retailers, panelists expenditure
shares would be 8.9% larger in this state.
