Much of my work done as a graduate research assistant involved working with the University of Nevada Reno's Extension office and University Center for Economic Development (UCED). Here I worked with Professor Tom Harris researching pertinent issues to the Nevadan Economy including:

1) Performed economic impact analysis of the COVID pandemic related to the CARES act funds and PPP loan programs for the Nevadan economy using Implan software.
   

2) Published technical reports comparing Payment in Lieu of Taxes (P.I.L.T.) monies received by Western States found here:  
[Extension: PILT report]([https://extension.unr.edu/publications.aspx](https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=4569))

3) Developed an improved cow-calf Nevada ranching model to account for drought conditions as well as decreased forage from reduced BLM permitted Animal Units per Month (AUM) allotments.
