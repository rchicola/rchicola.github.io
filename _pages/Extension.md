Much of my work done as a graduate research assistant involved working with the University of Nevada Reno's Extension office and University Center for Economic Development (UCED). Here I worked with Professor Tom Harris researching pertinent issues to the Nevadan Economy including:

1) Performed COVID pandemic economic impact analysis.  Specifically, CARES act funds and PPP loan program information was matched with the corresponding NAICS industry classification. Then using Implan software, the aggregated loan amounts to each industry were analyzed as impact events to determine their direct, indirect, and insuced impacts to the Nevadan economy.
   

2) Published technical reports comparing Payment in Lieu of Taxes (P.I.L.T.) monies received by Western States found here:  
[Extension: PILT report]([https://extension.unr.edu/publications.aspx](https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=4569)). 

3) Developed an improved cow-calf Nevada ranching model to account for drought conditions as well as decreased forage permits alloted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  A linear programming (LP) model using GAMS was employed to optimize net profits over a 50 year production horizon and determine the shadow values associated with decreases of water and BLM land allotments.
