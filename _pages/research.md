1) Job Market Paper: "Implications of Sales Tax Enforcement on E-commerce: Evidence from Nielsen Consumer Panel Data" Chicola, Randall. (2022)

My job market paper examines the sensitivity of e-commerce purchases to the imposition of state sales tax. This paper exploits timing variation in
the imposition of state sales tax onto online purchases to estimate demand elasticities for online and traditional brick and mortar retail shopping. The large
elasticities imply that collecting sales taxes from online retailers shifts consumption partially back to brick and mortar retailers.

2) "Joint Prediction and Simulation of Labor Force and Fiscal Conditions of Nevada Counties"

authors: Randall Chicola (University of Nevada, Reno), Man-Keun Kim (Utah State University) , Wuyang Hu (The Ohio State University), Thomas Harris (University of Nevada, Reno).

This study provides a system to jointly model labor and fiscal conditions of Nevada
counties. Each is specified as a system of equations that are linked by allowing variables
from the labor module to enter the fiscal module. Following the identification of parameters
in the two modules, a simulation analyzed to account for the effects of changes in exogenous
employment to the labor and fiscal status of each Nevada county in addition to dynamic
relationships of county budgets.
