Working Papers:

1) Job Market Paper: "Implications of Sales Tax Enforcement on E-commerce: Evidence from Nielsen Consumer Panel Data" Chicola, Randall. (2022)

My job market paper examines the sensitivity of e-commerce purchases to the imposition of state sales tax. This paper exploits timing variation in
the imposition of state sales tax onto online purchases to estimate demand elasticities for online and traditional brick and mortar retail shopping. The large
elasticities imply that collecting sales taxes from online retailers shifts consumption partially back to brick and mortar retailers.

2) "Joint Prediction and Simulation of Labor Force and Fiscal Conditions of Nevada Counties"

authors: Randall Chicola (University of Nevada, Reno), Man-Keun Kim (Utah State University) , Wuyang Hu (The Ohio State University), Thomas Harris (University of Nevada, Reno).

This study provides a system to jointly model labor and fiscal conditions of Nevada
counties. Each is specified as a system of equations that are linked by allowing variables
from the labor module to enter the fiscal module. Following the identification of parameters
in the two modules, a simulation analyzed to account for the effects of changes in exogenous
employment to the labor and fiscal status of each Nevada county in addition to dynamic
relationships of county budgets.

Works in Progress:

This meta-analysis explores the evidence regarding the extent of nominal price rigidity. This parameter is indispensable to prevailing Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models used to estimate outcomes of fiscal and monetary policy intervention. Typically, the greater the nominal price rigidity parameter, the more effective policy intervention tools are. Numerous studies have estimated this parameter, however estimates vary widely throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to study the sources of this variation and will be the first meta-analysis in this area of literature. These estimates arise from intricate structural models for which a system of controls was created to detail the subtle feature differences between each model's structure. The analysis will use meta regressions to pin down the parameter which could easily be used in future research as DSGE model inputs. Additionally, we will provide best practices for fitted estimates of the nominal price rigidity parameter based on the existing literature. From these contributions macroeconomists meaningfully discuss how estimates using different methodological approaches and model structure influence estimates reported throughout the literature.
