In fall of 2018 I was a teaching assistant for Professor Todd Sorensen's introductory microeconomics course which was a large lecture hall format of several hundred students. In spring of 2019, I was a teaching assistant for Professor Kym Pram in his two sections of intermediate microeconomics with approximately sixty students per section. I was also a teaching assistant for professor Shunfeng Song's introductory statistics class during the 2019 spring semester.
